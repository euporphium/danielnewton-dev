        <h2>Data Collection</h2>

          <li>Legitimate Interest: For understanding my audience and improving my services.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Data Transfer</h2>
        <p>Some data is processed outside the European Economic Area (EEA), for example by PostHog. This transfer is protected by appropriate safeguards, including Standard Contractual Clauses (SCC).</p>

        <h2>Retention Period</h2>
        <p>I retain data only as long as necessary for the purposes outlined in this policy. Third-party services retain data according to their own retention policies. You can request deletion of your data at any time by contacting me.</p>

        <h2>Security</h2>
        <p>The security of your personal information is important to me. I implement the following security measures:</p>

          <li>Regular security updates</li>
        </ul>
        <p>However, remember that no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. While I strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, I cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>
