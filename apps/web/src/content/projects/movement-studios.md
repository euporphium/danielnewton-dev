## Overview

Movement Studios is a fully responsive dance studio website that brings a Figma community design to life. The site showcases a Brooklyn-based dance facility offering diverse classes including Hip Hop, Jazz, and Contact Improvisation for dancers of all experience levels.

## Technical Highlights

### Modern Tech Stack

Built with cutting-edge technologies:
- **Next.js 16** with App Router and React Server Components
- **React 19.2.0** leveraging the latest features
- **TypeScript** for robust type safety
- **Tailwind CSS 4** with custom design tokens
- **Biome** for consistent code quality

### Custom Design System

One of the project's key achievements is a comprehensive design system implementation:

- **Responsive Typography Scale**: Fluid typography that adapts across three breakpoints (mobile, 800px, 1280px)
- **Three Integrated Google Fonts**: DM Sans, Encode Sans Expanded, and Encode Sans Semi Condensed
- **Semantic Color Tokens**: Meaningful naming conventions using CSS variables
- **Mobile-First Architecture**: Responsive navigation with hamburger menu for smaller screens

### Architecture & Code Quality

The project demonstrates modern React patterns and best practices:

- Clean separation of Client and Server Components following React 19 conventions
- Reusable component architecture with conditional styling utilities
- Semantic HTML for enhanced accessibility
- TypeScript throughout for type safety
- Biome-enforced code consistency

## Design Philosophy

The site features a sophisticated black and white photography aesthetic with strategic color accents (hot pink/red) that create visual impact. The design emphasizes movement and flow, perfectly aligning with the studio's philosophy: "Find your flow, and dance your truth."

## Project Origin

This project serves as a portfolio implementation of the ["Moody Dance Studio" Figma Community design](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1498101697479806427/moody-dance-studio), demonstrating the ability to transform design mockups into production-ready web applications. All visual design credit is attributed to the original Figma designer.
